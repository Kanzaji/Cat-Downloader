# Cat-Downloader
Cat Downloader is a simple Java based downloader for Minecraft Modpacks from CurseForge.

This is literally **my first project** in Java, so it is probably not the best :P

**Gson** and **Java 17** is required for compiling!

**Vazkii [InstanceSync](https://github.com/Vazkii/InstanceSync) code was used!** Thank you very much for the actual downloader part of this project <3

# Contributing
- Fork and clone respository on your machine.
- Setup Maven on your machine (For example, with use of Visual Studio Code addon)
- Just, makes changes and PR them here to Develop branch :sweat_smile:

I don't have Code of Conduct, or any Contributing Guidelines, because this is so small project that I use for learning Java, that I think they are a bit useless ^^"

Just please, provide some explanation of your code.

# Testing your build
If you have Maven setted up properly, just use command `mvn clean compile assemble:single`. It should create a file with Gson libraries inside.
