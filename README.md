# Cat-Downloader
Cat Downloader is a simple Java based downloader for Minecraft Modpacks from CurseForge.

This is literally **my first project** in Java, so it is probably not the best :P

**Vazkii [InstanceSync](https://github.com/Vazkii/InstanceSync) code was used!** Thank you very much for the actual downloader part of this project <3

**Gson** is required.

# Usage
1. Download a zipped modpack from CurseForge.
2. Unpack the zip in the directory of your Minecraft instance (For example, MultiMC)
3. Move files from `overrides` to your Minecraft instance folder.
4. Run the file `CatDownloader-1.0.1.jar` in your Minecraft Instance.
5. Install correct version of Minecraft and Forge/Fabric provided by Cat Downloader.
6. Play your modpack with all mods downloaded automatically \o/

# FAQ
---
- Q: Does it automatically update modpacks?
- A: No. This downloader *only downloads* mods from the pack, so updates need to be done manually by removing mods folder and all files that are provided in `overrides` folder.
---
- Q: Will there be a way to give the downloader a link to a modpack, and it will download it automatically?
- A: Someday... maybe...
