# Cat-Downloader
Cat Downloader is a simple Java based downloader for Minecraft Modpacks from CurseForge.

# Some info
Cat Downloader is literally my first project in Java, so it is probably not the best :P
Vazkii (InstanceSync)[https://github.com/Vazkii/InstanceSync] code was used! Thank you very much for the actual downloader part of this project.
This is also the reason this project is private. I'm not sure if using Vazkiis code is good... so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Usage
1 Download a zipped modpack from CurseForge.
2. Unpack the zip in the directory of your Minecraft instance (For example, MultiMC)
3. Move files from `overrides` to your Minecraft instance folder.
4. Run the file `cat-downloader-1.0.jar` in your MInecraft Instance.
5. Play your modpack with all mods downloaded automatically \o/

# FAQ
They aren't any yet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But few of them could be:

Q: Does it automatically update modpacks?
A: No. This downloader *only downloads* mods from the pack, so updates need to be done manually.

Q: Will there be a way to give the downloader a link to a modpack, and it will download it automatically?
A: Someday... maybe...
